/*
private Parent()----this implies that class Parent object can be created onlye in same class
it cannot be created outside the other class

final Parent()--- this acess modifieres cannot be used here because child class inherits the all members of
parents  except the constructor
in other words ,constructor cannot be override or inherited in java
so final written before constructor makes no sense because we use final before function to protect it from 
overiding and final before class is used to protect it from inherited
